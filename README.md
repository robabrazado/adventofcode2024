# adventofcode2024

This is my repo for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) 2024. I'm expecting a busier December this year than I'm used to, so instead of trying out another new language, I'm heading back to my old friend Java for this year. I'm also once again returning to [Eclipse](https://eclipseide.org/) this year and fiddling with [EGit](https://eclipse.dev/egit/) to simplify my pipeline.

As before, this README serves as kind of blog and running commentary that I'll be updating as the month progresses.

Shoutouts this year to (1) once again, the fun folks at the [Indie Game Reading Club](https://www.indiegamereadingclub.com/) for their company again and (2) my friend @codeforkjeff for encouraging me to shake off the coding dust and get back in it.
